Please visit localhost:3000/index after stating the server with mongo running at port 27017.

The basic idea is maintaining an ID which is autoIncrement by 1 from a starting number (20160723) and 
convert to hex. Since I am new to Node.js and mongo and the architecture might be not scalable 
and elegant. It is absolutly a interesting experience for me. Thank you very much.
