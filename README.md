Please visit localhost:3000/index after stating the server with mongo running at port 27017.

The basic idea is maintaining an ID which is autoIncrement by 1 from a starting number (20160723) and 
convert to hex. Since I never used Node.js and mongo before and I know the architecture might be not scalable 
and elegant. I used about 6 hours to implement it by learning from the official tutorial. It is absolutly 
a interesting experience for me. Thank you very much.
